However, the provider of this website does not guarantee the accuracy and timeliness of the free and freely accessible journalistic guides and news.

The provider has no influence whatsoever on the current and future design and content of the linked pages. The inclusion of external links does not mean that the provider adopts the content behind the reference or link as his own. A constant control of the external links is not reasonable for the provider without concrete evidence of legal violations. However, in the event of knowledge of legal infringements, such external links will be deleted immediately.<br />
