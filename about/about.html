    <h2>Simple Portfolio Page</h3>
        <p>In order to learn Webdevolpment my first real Website is creating my own Portfolio Page. I am using Html, Css and Javascript for the site's general functionaility and design; a MailChimp integrated form for the Contact page; Adobe Illustrator to create my own icons, logos and vector grapics as well as using Abobe XD for creating a basic Wireframe and Design overview. Lastly I deployed my Website on heroku and bought the domain at namecheap.</p>

  <p>After dropping out of University to start a company with my friends. I decided to build something of my own. I was always interested in coding but I never really pulled the trigger to start learning to code properly. After completing the Webdeveloper
          Bootcamp by Colt Steele, I am now doing my first steps in Coding by building up a portfolio of coding projects to cement the knowledge I gained during the course. I am also doing other courses as well as studying relevant Webdevelopment books.
          I also track my learing process on this site.</p>
