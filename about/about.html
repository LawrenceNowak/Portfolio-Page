        <p>After dropping out of University to start a company with my friends. I decided to build something of my own. I was always interested in coding but I never really pulled the trigger to start learning to code properly. After completing the Webdeveloper
            Bootcamp by Colt Steele, I am now doing my first steps in Coding by building up a portfolio of coding projects to cement the knowledge I gained during the course. I am also doing other courses as well as studying relevant Webdevelopment books.
            I also track my learing process on this site.</p>
