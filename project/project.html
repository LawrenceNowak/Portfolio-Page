    <h2>Simple Portfolio Page</h3>
        <p>In order to learn Webdevolpment my first real Website is creating my own Portfolio Page. I am using Html, Css and Javascript for the site's general functionaility and design; a MailChimp integrated form for the Contact page; Adobe Illustrator to create my own icons, logos and vector grapics as well as using Abobe XD for creating a basic Wireframe and Design overview. Lastly I deployed my Website on heroku and bought the domain at namecheap.</p>

<p>In order to increase my own productivity as well as tracking my own work pace, I used (and am still using) a webapp called Clockify.me. Its a free online time tracker that you use in your browser. The only issue I had was that I am using the pomodorotechnique. In short: The pomodoro technique is a method to increase ones productivity by splitting up a taskt in so called pomodori, which lasts 25 minutes. After one pomodori a 5 minute break ist held, after 4 pomodori, i.e. the 4th break, a
            longer break is being conducted, which lasts from 20 minutes to 25 minutes. The pomodori technique ensures high focus on any given task by eliminating the risk of procrastination. It gives you little timechunks where you can do whatever you please
            and scratch your procrastination itch. With the app I am currently working on I want to combine a timetracker with the pomodori technique to extract the net working time and the total working time. Also I want to visualise my data in form of graphs
            and whatnot
