          <strong>Legal basis for the processing of personal data </strong>
          <p>We would like to inform you about the legal basis for the processing of personal data:</p>
          <ol style="margin:10px 0px; padding:15px;">
              <li>If we have obtained your consent for the processing of personal data, Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. a) DS-GVO is the legal basis.</li>
              <li>If the processing is necessary for the fulfilment of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, which take place on your request, then Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. b) DS-GVO is the legal basis. </li>
              <li>If the processing is necessary to fulfil a legal obligation to which we are subject (e.g. legal storage obligations), Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. c) DS-GVO is the legal basis. </li>
              <li>If the processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. d) DS-GVO is the legal basis.</li>
              <li>If the processing is necessary to protect our interests or the legitimate interests of a third party and your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms do not prevail in this regard, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) DS-GVO is the legal basis. </li>
          </ol>
          <br />
          <strong>Share personal information with third parties and processors</strong>
          <p>Without your consent we do not pass on any data to third parties. Should this nevertheless be the case, then the passing on takes place on the basis of the aforementioned legal bases e.g. with the passing on of data to on-line Paymentanbieter for the fulfilment of a contract or due to judicial arrangement or due to a legal obligation to the publication of the data for the purpose of the criminal prosecution, for danger defence or for the penetration of the rights at the intellectual property.
              We also use contract processors (external service providers, e.g. for the web hosting of our websites and databases) to process your data. If data is passed on to contract processors within the framework of an agreement on order processing, this is always done in accordance with Art. 28 DS-GVO. We select our contract processors carefully, check them regularly and have been granted the right to issue instructions with regard to the data. In addition, the contract processors must have taken appropriate technical and organisational measures and comply with the data protection regulations in accordance with BDSG n.F. and DS-GVO </p>
  
          <br />
          <strong>Data transfers to third countries</strong>
          <p>The adoption of the European Data Protection Basic Regulation (DS-GVO) created a uniform basis for data protection in Europe. Your data will therefore mainly be processed by companies for which the DS-GVO applies. Should the processing by services of third parties not be possible
