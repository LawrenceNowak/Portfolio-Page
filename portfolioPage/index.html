    <h2>Simple Portfolio Page</h3>
        <p>In order to learn Webdevolpment my first real Website is creating my own Portfolio Page. I am using Html, Css and Javascript for the site's general functionaility and design; a MailChimp integrated form for the Contact page; Adobe Illustrator to create my own icons, logos and vector grapics as well as using Abobe XD for creating a basic Wireframe and Design overview. Lastly I deployed my Website on heroku and bought the domain at namecheap.</p>
