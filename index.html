      <h3>Currently Working on:</h3>
      <p>Time Tracker Webapp</p>
      <p>In order to increase my own productivity as well as tracking my own work pace, I used (and am still using) a webapp called Clockify.me. Its a free online time tracker that you use in your browser. The only issue I had was that I am using the pomodoro
        technique. In short: The pomodoro technique is a method to increase ones productivity by splitting up a taskt in so called pomodori, which lasts 25 minutes. After one pomodori a 5 minute break ist held, after 4 pomodori, i.e. the 4th break, a
        longer break is being conducted, which lasts from 20 minutes to 25 minutes. The pomodori technique ensures high focus on any given task by eliminating the risk of procrastination. It gives you little timechunks where you can do whatever you please
        and scratch your procrastination itch. With the app I am currently working on I want to combine a timetracker with the pomodori technique to extract the net working time and the total working time. Also I want to visualise my data in form of graphs
        and whatnot </p>

    <h2>About</h2>

    <article>
      <h3>Bio</h3>
      <p>After dropping out of University to start a company with my friends. I decided to build something of my own. I was always interested in coding but I never really pulled the trigger to start learning to code properly. After completing the Webdeveloper
        Bootcamp by Colt Steele, I am now doing my first steps in Coding by building up a portfolio of coding projects to cement the knowledge I gained during the course. I am also doing other courses as well as studying relevant Webdevelopment books.
        I also track my learing process on this site.</p>
